## File Operations in Linux

### 1. Using `*` with `cp`

# Create the 'exercise' directory and the 'backup' subdirectory
mkdir -p ~/exercise/backup

# Create three files: two .txt files and one .log file
touch ~/exercise/file1.txt ~/exercise/file2.txt ~/exercise/file3.log

# Copy only the .txt files to the 'backup' directory
cp ~/exercise/*.txt ~/exercise/backup/


---

### 2. Using `?` with `mv`

# Create the 'logs' directory
mkdir -p ~/exercise/logs

# Create three .log files (only two with names of 4 characters)
touch ~/exercise/log1.log ~/exercise/log2.log ~/exercise/logLonger.log

# Move the .log files with 4 characters to the 'logs' directory
mv ~/exercise/log?.log ~/exercise/logs/


---

### 3. Using `[]` with `rm`

# Create .tmp files
touch file1.tmp file2.tmp file3.tmp file4.tmp

# Remove only the files that end with 1, 2, or 3
rm file[1-3].tmp


---

### 4. Using `*` and `?` with `cp`

# Create the directory and files
mkdir -p ~/exercise/backup
touch backupabc.txt backup123.txt backupxy.txt

# Copy only the files that match the pattern
cp backup???* ~/exercise/backup/


---

### 5. Using `*` and `[]` with `mv`

# Create the directory and files
mkdir -p ~/exercise/reports/pdf
touch report1.pdf report2.pdf report6.pdf

# Move only the valid files
mv report[1-5].pdf ~/exercise/reports/pdf/


---

### 6. Combined Use of `*`, `?`, and `[]` with `rm`

# Create the files
touch temp1a.tmp temp2b.tmp temp3c.tmp

# Remove only the valid files
rm temp[a-z][0-9].tmp


---

### 7. Using `*` and `{}` with `mv`

# Create the directory and files
mkdir -p ~/exercise/images
touch image1.jpg image2.png image3.gif

# Move the files with the required extensions
mv *.{jpg,png} ~/exercise/images/


---

### 8. Complex Use of `*`, `?`, and `{}` with `cp`

# Create the directory and files
mkdir -p ~/exercise/documents/backup
touch doc1.doc doc2.doc doc3.txt

# Copy the valid files to the backup folder
cp doc?[0-9].{doc,txt} ~/exercise/documents/backup/


---

### 9. Using `*` with `mv`

# Create the directory and files
mkdir -p ~/exercise/numerics
touch file123.txt data2.csv fileabc.txt

# Move only the files that contain numbers
mv *[0-9]* ~/exercise/numerics/


---

### 10. Combined Use of `?` and `[]` with `cp`

# Create the directory and files
mkdir -p ~/exercise/archive
touch dataa1.csv dataf2.csv datag3.csv

# Copy the files that match the pattern
cp data[abc][0-9].csv ~/exercise/archive/


---

### 11. Complex Use of `*`, `?`, and `[]` with `rm`

# Create files that follow and do not follow the requested pattern
touch log1.old log12.bak log99.old notlog.bak

# Remove only the valid files
rm log[0-9][0-9]?.{old,bak}

This repository includes a series of Linux commands demonstrating file manipulation techniques using wildcard characters. Each section provides step-by-step instructions to create files, move them, and delete them based on specified patterns, making it a practical resource for learning file operations in a Linux environment.
