The `top` command in Linux is a powerful utility for monitoring system processes and resource usage in real-time. It displays a list of currently running processes, along with information about CPU and memory usage, and allows you to interactively manage processes. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how to use `top`, its output, and useful features:

### Basic Usage

To run the `top` command, simply open a terminal and type:

```bash
top
```

### Understanding the Output

When you run `top`, you'll see an interface that updates every few seconds. The output is typically divided into two main sections:

1. **Summary Area** (at the top):
    - Displays system information, including:
        - **Uptime**: How long the system has been running.
        - **Number of users**: Current active users.
        - **Load average**: System load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
        - **CPU usage**: Breakdown of CPU time (user, system, nice, idle, etc.).
        - **Memory usage**: Total, used, free, and cached memory.
2. **Task Area** (below the summary):
    - Lists currently running processes with the following columns:
        - **PID**: Process ID.
        - **USER**: User who owns the process.
        - **PR**: Priority of the process.
        - **NI**: Niceness value (indicates priority).
        - **VIRT**: Virtual memory used by the process.
        - **RES**: Resident memory (physical RAM) used.
        - **SHR**: Shared memory used.
        - **S**: Process state (e.g., S for sleeping, R for running).
        - **%CPU**: CPU usage percentage.
        - **%MEM**: Memory usage percentage.
        - **TIME+**: Total CPU time used by the process.
        - **COMMAND**: Command or name of the process.
