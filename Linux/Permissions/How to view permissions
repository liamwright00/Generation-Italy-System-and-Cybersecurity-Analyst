The `ls -l` command in Linux allows you to view detailed file and directory permissions, along with information about whether the object is a file, directory, or symbolic (soft) link.

## Usage

Run the following command to see the detailed information:

```bash
ls -l
```

You will get output similar to this:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Oct 16 13:45 directory_name
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 2048 Oct 16 12:30 file_name.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user   12 Oct 16 11:30 softlink -> /path/to/file
```

## Breakdown of the Output

Each line in the output has multiple parts. Here's how to interpret them:

### 1. **File Type (First Character)**

- `d`: Directory
- `-`: Regular file
- `l`: Symbolic link (soft link)

### 2. **Permissions (Next 9 Characters)**

Permissions are divided into three groups:
- **Owner** (first 3 characters)
- **Group** (next 3 characters)
- **Others** (last 3 characters)

Within each group, permissions are represented as:
- `r`: Read
- `w`: Write
- `x`: Execute
- `-`: No permission

#### Example:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x
```
This means:
- **Owner**: `rwx` (Read, Write, Execute)
- **Group**: `r-x` (Read, Execute)
- **Others**: `r-x` (Read, Execute)

### 3. **Additional Columns**

- **Number of links**: Number of hard links or subdirectories.
- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: The group that owns the file.
- **Size**: The file size in bytes.
- **Last modified**: Date and time when the file was last modified.
- **File name**: The name of the file or directory.

## Examples of File Types and Permissions

### Directory

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Oct 16 13:45 directory_name
```

- This is a directory where:
  - The owner has full control (read, write, execute).
  - The group and others have read and execute permissions.

### Regular File

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 2048 Oct 16 12:30 file_name.txt
```

- This is a file where:
  - The owner can read and write.
  - The group and others can only read.

### Symbolic Link

```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user   12 Oct 16 11:30 softlink -> /path/to/file
```

- This is a soft link where:
  - Everyone has full permissions to the link itself (though this does not affect the target file's permissions).
