The PATH variable is one of the most fundamental environment variables in Linux. 
It defines the list of directories that the shell searches when you type a command on the command line. 
If the command you type is located in one of the directories listed in PATH, it will be executed. Otherwise, the system will return an error saying the command wasn't found. 
You can view or modify PATH as needed using commands like echo $PATH to see its value and export PATH=new_path:$PATH to add new directories.
