In Linux, variables can be managed using commands like `echo` and `unset`. Here’s how it works:

- **Local variables:** You define a variable by assigning a value, like `name="Liam"`. You can check its value using `echo $name`, which outputs "Liam."
- **Environment variables:** If you want this variable to be available to other processes, you use `export name`. Now it's an environment variable.
- **Unset command:** To remove a variable, use `unset name`. After that, running `echo $name` will return nothing, as the variable no longer exists.


```bash
name="Liam"
echo $name   # Output: Liam
export name  # Now it's an environment variable
unset name   # Removes the variable
echo $name   # No output
```
