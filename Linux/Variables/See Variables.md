To view variables in Linux, you can use the following commands:

1. **`set`**: Displays all variables (both local and global) defined in the current shell session, along with their values. It also shows shell functions.
    
    ```bash
    set
    
    ```
    
2. **`env`**: Displays only the environment (global) variables that are exported to child processes.
    
    ```bash
    env
    
    ```
    

These commands allow you to inspect the current variables and their scope, with `set` being more comprehensive and `env` focusing on global variables.
