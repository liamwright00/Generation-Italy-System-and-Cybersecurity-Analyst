- `type:` **type** command in Linux is a useful utility for identifying how the shell will interpret a given command. It provides information on whether a command is a shell built-in, external binary, function, or alias, helping users understand the source of the command and its behavior.
    
    To reveal all the paths of the `less` command, execute the type command with the `-a` option:
    
    ```
    type -a less
    ```
