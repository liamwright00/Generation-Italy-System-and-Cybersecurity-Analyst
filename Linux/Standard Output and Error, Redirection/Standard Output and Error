### Standard Output and Standard Error in Linux

- **Standard Output (stdout)**: The default output stream where a program sends its normal output. By default, this is displayed in the terminal. Its value is `1`.

- **Standard Error (stderr)**: The default output stream where a program sends its error messages. This is also displayed in the terminal by default, but it's separate from standard output. Its value is `2`.
