# Step 6: Open the `.bashrc` file (this step requires manual intervention to edit the file)
# You would normally open it like this:
# nano ~/.bashrc

# Adding aliases (for this script, we'll just demonstrate adding them dynamically)
echo "alias patronus='echo \"Expecto Patronum!\"'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias lumos='echo \"Lumos!\"'" >> ~/.bashrc

# Step 7: Source the `.bashrc` file to apply the alias changes
source ~/.bashrc

# Step 8: Use the alias patronus and lumos to print "Expecto Patronum!" and "Lumos!"
patronus
lumos

# Step 9: Use the pwd command to print the current directory.
pwd

# Step 10: Use the cd command to change the current directory to /tmp.
cd /tmp

# Step 11: Create a new directory named chamber_of_secrets inside /tmp.
mkdir chamber_of_secrets

# Step 12: Navigate to the chamber_of_secrets directory and create three empty files.
cd chamber_of_secrets
touch diary_tom_riddle.txt basilisk.txt chamber_secret.txt

# Step 13: Use the ls command to list the files in the chamber_of_secrets directory.
ls

# Step 14: Delete the file basilisk.txt using the rm command.
rm basilisk.txt
