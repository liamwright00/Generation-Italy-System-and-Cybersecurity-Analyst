```bash
# Step 1: Create a variable named WIZARD and assign it the name of your favorite Harry Potter character.
```bash
WIZARD="Harry Potter"  # Change this to your favorite character
```

# Step 2: Create a variable named SPELL and assign it the value "Expecto Patronum."
```bash
SPELL="Expecto Patronum"
```

# Step 3: Create a variable named SCHOOL and assign it the value "Hogwarts."
```bash

```

# Step 4: Use the echo command to print the values of the variables WIZARD, SPELL, and SCHOOL on the screen.
```bash
echo "Wizard: $WIZARD"
echo "Spell: $SPELL"
echo "School: $SCHOOL"
```

# Step 5: Redirect the output of the command ls /platform_9¾ (a fictitious directory) to a file named errors_hogwarts.txt.
```bash
ls /platform_9¾ > errors_hogwarts.txt 2> /dev/null  # Redirecting errors to /dev/null

# Step 6: Open the `.bashrc` file
You can use any text editor you prefer. Here’s how to open it using `nano`:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

# Step 7: Add the Aliases
Scroll to the bottom of the `.bashrc` file and add the following lines:

```bash
# Custom Aliases
alias patronus='echo "Expecto Patronum!"'
alias lumos='echo "Lumos!"'
```

# Step 8: Save and Exit
If you're using `nano`, save the file by pressing `CTRL + O`, then hit `Enter`, and exit with `CTRL + X`.

# Step 9: Source the `.bashrc` File
To apply the changes you made, run the following command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
```


# Step 10: Use the alias patronus to print "Expecto Patronum!" and lumos to print "Lumos!" on the screen.
```bash
patronus
lumos
```

# Step 11: Use the pwd command to print the current directory.
```bash
pwd
```

# Step 12: Use the cd command to change the current directory to /tmp.
```bash
cd /tmp
```

# Step 13: Create a new directory named chamber_of_secrets inside /tmp.
```bash
mkdir chamber_of_secrets
```

# Step 14: Navigate to the chamber_of_secrets directory and create three empty files.
```bash
cd chamber_of_secrets
touch diary_tom_riddle.txt basilisk.txt chamber_secret.txt
```

# Step 15: Use the ls command to list the files in the chamber_of_secrets directory.
```bash
ls
```

# Step 16: Delete the file basilisk.txt using the rm command.
```bash
rm basilisk.txt
```
