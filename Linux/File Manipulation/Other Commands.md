### `cat | grep`

Combines commands to search for specific text within a file.

**Example**:
```bash
cat example | grep "world"
```

#### Breakdown of the Command
1. **`cat example`**: Reads the content of a file named **`example`** and displays it in the terminal.
2. **`|` (Pipe)**: Takes the output from the command on its left (the content of the `example` file) and sends it as input to the command on its right (`grep`).
3. **`grep "world"`**: Searches through the input received (the content from the `example` file) for lines containing the word **`world`** and prints those lines to the terminal.

#### Pipeline Explanation
- A **pipeline** allows you to connect multiple commands so that the output of one command can be used as input for another. In this example, the output from `cat` (the content of the file) is piped directly into `grep`, which filters that content.

#### Simple Summary
- The command reads a file and searches for lines containing the word "world." If it finds any, it shows those lines. The pipe connects the two commands for seamless operation.

### `pstree`

Displays a tree view of the processes running on your machine.

**Example**:
```bash
pstree
```
This command provides a visual representation of the processes and their relationships.

---

### `less`

Allows you to view the content of a file in a scrollable manner.

**Example**:
```bash
less example.txt
```
This command opens `example.txt`, enabling you to scroll through the content. Press `q` to exit.

---

### `more`

A paginated viewer for files.

**Example**:
```bash
more example.txt
```
This command opens the file `example.txt` in a paginated viewer. Use the space bar to move to the next page, `Enter` to move down one line, and `q` to exit.

---

### `head`

Displays the first 10 lines of a file.

**Example**:
```bash
head example.txt
```
This command shows the first 10 lines of `example.txt`.

---

### `tail`

**Example**:
```bash
tail example.txt
```
This command shows the last 10 lines of `example.txt`.
